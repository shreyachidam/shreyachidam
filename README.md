## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data storyteller and strategist helping teams solve meaningful problems through clarity, systems thinking, and collaboration.
— grounded in a strong understanding of the full data lifecycle.


Most recently, I consulted at **PG&E**, where I:
- Led development a PowerApps tool to support recovery operations across 3 business units  
- Automated weekly business reviews used by PG&E executives to accelerate response timelines  
- Delivered performance-tracking dashboards in Power BI to guide internal strategy across Engineering and Safety programs

Previously, I’ve worked across analytics and product roles at:
- **Claritas** – Built an AI-based customer segmentation framework and predictive lead ranking using psychometric and browsing data  
- **NBA** – Designed a dynamic pricing algorithm using seat scoring and visitor team demand to optimize ticket pricing for the 2022–2023 season  
- **Cisco** – Supported global collaboration solutions for product teams across 5 time zones, recommending async tooling flows  
- **Zurn Elkay** – Led competitive analysis for 10+ product lines and created executive-level research reports to inform GTM decisions in the water tech space


I also served as the **Strategic Marketing Lead** for Cal Poly’s MSBA program, where I scaled outreach to 1,700+ international students and drove a 40% spike in info session attendance.

My superpowers? Cross-functional collaboration, clean data storytelling, and always thinking about the human behind the data.
