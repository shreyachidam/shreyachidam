## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data storyteller and strategist with hands-on experience across internal tooling, customer segmentation, and decision intelligence — grounded in a strong understanding of the full data lifecycle.

Most recently, I consulted at **PG&E**, where I:
- Launched a PowerApps tool to streamline program recovery  
- Delivered weekly business reviews used by executives to accelerate decisions  
- Optimized Power BI dashboards for key performance tracking

Previously, I’ve worked across analytics, product, and marketing roles at:
- **Claritas**, where I built AI-driven audience segmentation and predictive ranking tools  
- **The NBA**, where I developed dynamic ticket pricing models based on demand and seat quality  
- **Cisco**, where I enhanced global collaboration for supply chain teams  
- **Zurn Elkay**, where I led competitive analysis and GTM research in product management

I also served as the **Strategic Marketing Lead** for Cal Poly’s MSBA program, where I scaled outreach to 1,700+ international students and drove a 40% spike in info session attendance.

My superpowers? Cross-functional collaboration, clean data storytelling, and always thinking about the human behind the data.
